The ALX3 protein, encoded by the gene, is a, meaning that it binds to and obtains control over the action of other genes. The ALX3 protein specifically controls genes that regulate,, and. This protein is essential for the development of the and, specifically the. This event begins around the fourth week of. At least 7s in the ALX3 gene are known to cause. The mutations eliminate the function of the ALX3 protein, resulting in decreased ability to bind to DNA. The loss of regulatory function results in uncontrolled cell proliferation and migration during. One particular form of the disorder, called frontonasal dysplasia type 1, presents with abnormal development of structures in the middle of the face. The most common malformation of this defect is a cleft in the,, and. ALX3 was first discovered by a group of scientists, led by Hopi Hoekstra, a biologist from Harvard University, that investigated how stripe patterns form in animals. They investigated the ''Rhabdomys pumiliom'', commonly known as the African striped mouse because of the alternating colored stripes observed on its back. One of the members of the team, Ricardo Mallarino, discovered that the stripes were formed during embryogenesis in the mice. Melanocytes, the specialized cells that produce the pigments in the skin, were not active in areas where the lighter stripes were observed. They then researched the genes active in those areas using RNA sequencing. They discovered that ALX3 was expressed in the light hair areas but not in the dark hair areas. They found that all mice expressed the gene on their abdomen but only the African striped mouse expressed it on its back, hence why the strips appear. Protein-DNA binding was then performed to determine where the ALX3 protein binds on the DNA. ALX3 binds to the promoter and represses MITF, which allows transcription to take place when making melanocytes. More tests were performed to confirm the function of ALX3 within the African striped mice. The gene was observed in other rodents such as the North American chipmunks and deemed responsible for the similar outcomes. The differences in evolution amongst the species did not hinder the similarities in the expression of the gene. This led the team to believe that ALX3 may have the same effect in mammals. However, further studies must be completed to confirm that ALX3 is responsible for the same in other mammals."
ALX4,"Homeobox protein aristaless-like 4 is a that in humans is encoded by the ''ALX4''. Alx4 belongs to the group-1 aristaless-related genes, a majority of which are linked to the development of the and/or skeleton, along with,,, and. The Alx4 protein acts as a transcriptional activator and is predominantly expressed in the of the developing embryonic limb buds. Transcripts of this gene are detectable in the just prior to limb induction. Alx4 expression plays a major role in the determination of spatial orientation of the growing limb bud by aiding in the establishment of anteroposterior polarity of the limb. It does this by working in conjunction with and dHand to restrict the expression of (SHh) to the posterior mesenchyme, which will eventually give rise to the (ZPA). This gene has been proven to be with mutations and deletions giving rise to a host of craniofacial dismorphologies and several forms of in mammalian development.

ALYREF,"Aly/REF export factor, also known as THO complex subunit 4 is a that in humans is encoded by the ''ALYREF''. The ALYREF encodes Aly/REF export factor (ALY; THO complex subunit 4, Tho4; RNA and export factor binding protein 1, Refbp1), a ubiquitously expressed that functions as a and export adapter involved in nuclear export of spliced and unspliced. The, a key player in mRNA export, includes the THO subcomplex, the RNA helicase UAP56, and the RNA-binding protein ALY. In yeast, TREX is recruited co-transcriptionally; in human cells it is recruited during a late step of splicing. The human TREX complex is recruited to a region near the 5' end of mRNA by interaction of ALY and THO with the nuclear cap-binding complex. As a chaperone, ALY promotes dimerization of transcription factors containing basic leucine zipper () domains., thereby promoting transcriptional activation. ALY has key roles in 3'-end processing of polyadenylated mRNAs and in nuclear export of both polyadenylated and non-polyadenylated mRNAs. After mRNA binds to ALY, it is apparently transferred to the NXF1-NXT1 heterodimer for export (TAP/NFX1 pathway). The full-length ALY protein (Refbp1-I, 255 amino acids encoded by six exons) has a conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM; amino acids 105-182) flanked by alanine/arginine/glycine-rich sequences; an N-terminal region (amino acids 16-37) is sufficient for RNA binding and interaction with the NXF1-NXT1 heterodimer."

ARAF,"Serine/threonine-protein kinase A-Raf or simply A-Raf is an that in humans is encoded by the ''ARAF''. In addition, the A-Raf protein has amino acid substitutions in a negatively charged region upstream of the kinase domain (N-region). This could be responsible for its low basal activity. Like Raf-1 and B-Raf, A-Raf activates MEK proteins which causes the activation of ERK and ultimately leads to cell cycle progression and cell proliferation. All three Raf proteins are located in the cytosol in their inactive state when bound to 14-3-3. In the presence of active Ras, they translocate to the plasma membrane. Among the Ras kinase family, A-Raf has the lowest kinase activity towards MEK proteins in the Raf kinase family. Thus, it is possible that A-Raf has other functions outside the MAPK pathway or that it helps the other Raf kinases activate the MAPK pathway. In addition to phosphorylating MEK, A-Raf also inhibits MST2, a tumor suppressor and proapoptotic kinase not found in the MAPK pathway. By inhibiting MST2, A-Raf can prevent apoptosis from occurring. However, this inhibition is only possible when the splice factor heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H (hnRNP H) maintains the expression of a full-length A-Raf protein. Tumorous cells often overexpress hnRNP H. When hnRNP H is downregulated, the A-RAF gene is alternatively spliced. This prevents the expression of full-length A-Raf protein. Thus, overexpression of hnRNP H in tumor cells leads to full-length expression of A-Raf which then inhibits apoptosis, allowing cancerous cells that should be destroyed to stay alive. A-Raf also binds to pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), again outside the MAPK pathway. PKM2 is an isozyme of pyruvate kinase that is responsible for the Warburg effect in cancer cells. A-Raf upregulates the activity of PKM2 by promoting a conformational change in PKM2. This causes PKM2 to transition from its low-activity dimeric form to a highly active tetrameric form. In cancer cells, the ratio between dimeric and tetrameric forms of PKM2 determines what happens to glucose carbons. If PKM2 is in the dimeric form, glucose is channeled into synthetic processes such as nucleic acid, amino acid, or phospholipid synthesis. If A-Raf is present, PKM2 is more likely to be in the tetrameric form. This causes more glucose carbons to be converted to pyruvate and lactate, producing energy for the cell. Thus, A-Raf can be linked to energy metabolism regulation and cell transformation, both of which are very important in tumorigenesis. In addition, researchers have proposed a model of how A-Raf is linked to endocytosis. Upstream of A-Raf, receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are activated, leading to RAS-mediated activation of Raf kinases, including A-Raf. Once activated, A-Raf binds to membranes rich in Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns (4,5)P and signals endosomes. This leads to activation of ARF6, a central regulator of endocytic trafficking."

When activated by ligands, the CD80 expression is upregulated in (APCs). The CD86 expression on antigen-presenting cells is constitutive (expression is independent of environmental factors). CD28 is the only receptor constitutively expressed ons. Association of the TCR of a with: complex without CD28:B7 interaction results in a T cell that is. Furthermore, CD28 was also identified on bone marrow stromal cells, plasma cells, neutrophils and eosinophils, but the functional importance of CD28 on these cells is not completely understood. It is generally reported, that CD28 is expressed on 50% of T cells and more than 80% in human, but during the course of activation some T cells lose this molecule. Some antigen-experienced T cells lose CD28 and subsequently can be re-activated without CD28 engagement. These CD28 T cells have generally been characterized as antigen specific and terminally differentiated, and are often described as being. In addition, the level of positive CD28 decreases with age. As a homodimer of two chains with Ig domains binds B7 molecules on APCs and it can promotes T cells proliferation and differentiation, stimulates production of growth factors and induces the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins. According to several studies, after birth, all human cells express CD28. But in adult, 20-30% of CD8+ T cells lose the ability of CD28 expression, whereas in the elderly (+80 years) up to 50-60% of CD8+ cells lose the ability of CD28 expression. But these statements only suggest that loss of CD28 expression marks functional differentiation to cytotoxic memory cells within clonal expansions. In general, CD28 is a primary costimulatory molecule for T cell activation. But effective co-stimulation is essential only for some T cell activation. In this case, in the absence of co-stimulatory signals, the interaction of dendritic and T cells leads to T cell anergy. The importance of the costimulatory pathway is underlined by the fact that antagonists of co-stimulatory molecules disrupt the immune responses both ''in vitro'' and ''in vivo''. But as mentioned earlier, during the course of activation e.g. TMs lose this molecule and assume a CD28-independent existence."

CER1 (gene),"Cerberus is a that in humans is encoded by the ''CER1''. Cerberus is a signaling molecule which contributes to the formation of the head, heart and of internal organs. This gene varies slightly from species to species but its overall functions seem to be similar. Cerberus is secreted by the and blocks the action of BMP, Nodal and Wnt, secreted by the primitive node, which allows for the formation of a head region. This is accomplished by inhibiting the formation of mesoderm in this region. Knockdown experiments have helped to explain Cerberus's role in both the formation of the head and left and right symmetry. These experiments have shown that Cerberus helps to keep Nodal from crossing to the right side of the developing embryo, allowing left and right asymmetry to form. This is why misexpression of Cerberus can cause the heart to fold in the opposite direction during development. When Cerberus is “knocked down” and BMP and Wnt are up regulated the head does not form. Other experiments using mice that this gene has been “knocked out” showed no head defects, which suggest that it is the combination of the up regulation of BMP and Wnt along with the absence of Cerberus that causes this defect. The Cerberus gene family produces many different signal proteins that are antagonistically involved in establishing anterior-posterior patterning and left-right patterning in vertebrate embryos."

Its principal function is to regulate the of the, ensuring that the complement system is directed towards or other dangerous material and does not damage host tissue. Factor H regulates complement activation on self cells and surfaces by possessing both cofactor activity for the mediated cleavage, and decay accelerating activity against the alternative pathway, C3bBb. Factor H exerts its protective action on self cells and self surfaces but not on the surfaces of or. There are however, important exceptions, such as for example the bacterial pathogen, '' (also called the meningococcus).'' This human pathogen has evolved mechanisms to recruit human FH and down-regulate the alternative pathway. Binding of FH permits the bacteria to proliferate in the bloodstream and cause disease. The ability of Factor H to exert its protective action on self cells and self surfaces is thought to be the result of Factor H having the ability to adopt conformations with lower or higher activities as a cofactor for C3 cleavage or decay accelerating activity. The lower activity conformation is the predominant form in solution and is sufficient to control fluid phase amplification. The more active conformation is thought to be induced when Factor H binds to (GAGs) and ors that are generally present on host cells but not, normally, on pathogen surfaces ensuring that self surfaces are protected whilst complement proceeds unabated on foreign surfaces."

COBL,"Protein cordon-bleu is a that in humans is encoded by the COBL. The Cordon-bleu protein was first described in 2007. Cobl was demonstrated to be a brain-enriched, Wiskott-Aldrich Homology 2-based actin nucleator playing a pivotal role in morphogenetic processes in the vertebrate central nervous system (CNS) that give rise to the complex dendritic arbor of neuronal cells. The Cobl gene was originally identified in lacZ-gene-trap experiments in mice. Cobl mRNA was detected as early as at day 7.5 post-coitum (E7.5) in the gastrula organizer and extended towards the axial midline at E8. The organizer is a small group of embryonal cells that organizes the entire body plan because it gives rise to the axial midline – an important source of patterning and morphogenesis cues. The human ''COBL'' gene encodes a 1261-amino acid protein with a mass of about 136 kDa. The mouse protein is 1337 amino acids long. The cobl gene in mice and human gives rise to a variety of putative splice variants, which, however, have not yet been analyzed at the protein level. Cobl genes seem to be restricted to vertebrates. Cobl was discovered as an actin nucleator in F-actin formation assays with brain cytosol depleted for the Arp2/3 complex (the only other actin nucleator known at this time) and with beads coated with the SH3 domain of the (Abp1) and with the SH3 domain of, respectively, and subsequent yeast two-hybrid screening for putatively responsible components using a brain cDNA library. Cobl was then cloned fully and its neuronal functions were characterized in primary neuronal cultures and in mice. The WH2 domain-based actin nucleator Cobl turned out to be critical for the induction of dendritic branches in both hippocampal neurons and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, as revealed by RNAi experiments.<ref name=""Ahuja_2007"" /><ref name=""Haag_2012"" /> Cobl hereby specifically accumulates at nascent dendritic branch sites prior to a burst of local F-actin formation at these sites.<ref name=""Hou_2015"" /> Cobl gives rise to actin filaments by bringing together 3 actin monomers by the use of its three C-terminal WH2 domains, as shown by in vitro reconstitutions with the purified C-terminus of Cobl. In addition to the three C-terminal WH2 domains, also the presence of the linker region L2 between the second and third WH2 domain was of importance for Cobl-mediated actin nucleation. Cobl assembles non-bundled, unbranched actin filaments.<ref name=""Ahuja_2007"" /> In contrast to other actin nucleators, which are directly or indirectly via their activators controlled by Rho type GTPases, Cobl hereby is controlled by calcium/calmodulin signalling and by arginine methylation brought about by the arginine methyltransferase 2.<ref name=""Hou_2018"" /> Consistently, both CaM inhibitors and inhibitors of arginine methylation fully suppressed Cobl-induced dendritic branch induction. Furthermore, Cobl mutants lacking the PRMT2 binding site or lacking CaM-binding regions failed to power dendritic branching.<ref name=""Hou_2015"" /><ref name=""Hou_2018"" /> The molecular mechanisms, by which Ca2+ signals control the actin nucleator Cobl, are quite complex and may reflect a high level of fine-tuning Cobl's physiological functions to Ca2+ transients in neuronal cells. Cobl is regulated by Ca2+ signals in at least three distinct ways (Izadi and Hou et al., 2018). These modes involve all three WH2 domains of Cobl, which closely need to work together to nucleate actin effectively.<ref name=""Ahuja_2007"" /> Interestingly, Ca2+/CaM controls not only the actin cytoskeletal aspects of Cobl functions but also its targeting to the plasma membrane - a prerequisite for F-actin-driven force generation shaping the morphology of cells. Mutational analyses showed that both individual CaM-dependent regulatory mechanisms are crucial for Cobl-mediated dendritogenesis.<ref name=""Hou_2015"" /> The required recruitment of Cobl to the dendritic plasma membrane is brought about by Cobl's own ability to associate with membrane lipids and by the membrane-binding protein syndapin I, which is critical for Cobl's membrane targeting and function.<ref name=""Schwintzer_2011"" />"

The latter class constitutes the major proteins of vertebrate eye lens and maintains the transparency and of the lens. Since lose their nuclei during development, these crystallins are made and then retained throughout life, making them extremely stable proteins. Mammalian lens crystallins are divided into alpha, beta, and gamma families; beta and gamma crystallins are also considered as a superfamily. Alpha and beta families are further divided into acidic and basic groups. Seven protein regions exist in crystallins: four homologous motifs, a connecting peptide, and N- and C-terminal extensions. Alpha crystallins are composed of two gene products: alpha-A and alpha-B, for acidic and basic, respectively. Alpha crystallins can be induced by heat shock and are members of the (sHSP also known as the HSP20) family. They act as molecular although they do not renature proteins and release them in the fashion of a true chaperone; instead they hold them in large soluble. Post-translational modifications decrease the ability to chaperone. These heterogeneous aggregates consist of 30-40 subunits; the alpha-A and alpha-B subunits have a 3:1 ratio, respectively. Two additional functions of alpha crystallins are an autokinase activity and participation in the intracellular architecture.

CRYBA1,"Beta-crystallin A3 is a that in humans is encoded by the ''CRYBA1''. Crystallins are separated into two classes: taxon-specific, or enzyme, and ubiquitous. The latter class constitutes the major proteins of vertebrate eye lens and maintains the transparency and refractive index of the lens. Since lens central fiber cells lose their nuclei during development, these crystallins are made and then retained throughout life, making them extremely stable proteins. Mammalian lens crystallins are divided into alpha, beta, and gamma families; beta and gamma crystallins are also considered as a superfamily. Alpha and beta families are further divided into acidic and basic groups. Seven protein regions exist in crystallins: four homologous motifs, a connecting peptide, and N- and C-terminal extensions. Beta-crystallins, the most heterogeneous, differ by the presence of the C-terminal extension (present in the basic group, none in the acidic group). Beta-crystallins form aggregates of different sizes and are able to self-associate to form dimers or to form heterodimers with other beta-crystallins. This gene, a beta acidic group member, encodes two proteins (crystallin, beta A3 and crystallin, beta A1) from a single mRNA, the latter protein is 17 aa shorter than crystallin, beta A3 and is generated by use of an alternate translation initiation site.

CYP4F12,"Cytochrome P450 4F12 is a that in humans is encoded by the ''CYP4F12''. This gene encodes a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes and is part of a cluster of cytochrome P450 genes on chromosome 19. The cytochrome P450 proteins are monooxygenases which catalyze many reactions involved in drug metabolism and synthesis of cholesterol, steroids and other lipids. This protein likely localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum. CYP4F12 is expressed in the liver and throughout the gastrointestinal track, is known to metabolize the anti-histamine drugs, and, and therefore is suggested to be positioned for and possibly involved in the processing of these and perhaps other drugs. When expressed in yeast the enzyme is capable of oxidizing by adding a residue to carbons 18 or 19 to form 18-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (18-HETE) or 19-HETE; however, its physiological function in doing so has not been determined. CYP4F12 also metabolizes (PGH2) and PGH1 to their corresponding 19-hydroxyl analogs in a reaction that might serve to reduce their activities. In addition to these actions, CYP458 possesses activity: it metabolizes thes, (DHA) and, (EPA) to their correspondings, thes (EDPs) ands (EEQs), respectively. The enzyme metabolizes DHA primarily to 19''R'',20''S''-epoxyeicosapentaenoic acid and 19''S'',20''R''-epoxyeicosapentaenoic acid isomers (termed 19,20-EDP) and EPA primarily to 17''R'',18''S''-eicosatetraenoic acid and 17''S'',18''R''-eicosatetraenoic acid isomers (termed 17,18-EEQ). It is suggested that the EDP and EEQ metabolites function in humans as they do in animal models and that, as products of thes, DHA acid and EPA, the EDP and EEQ metabolites contribute to many of the beneficial effects attributed to dietary omega-3 fatty acids. EDP and EEQ metabolites are short-lived, being inactivated within seconds or minutes of formation bys, particularly, and therefore act locally. The fatty acid metabolizing activity, including the ability to form epoxides, of CYP4F12 is very similar to that of. However, it and CYP4F8 are not regarded as being major contributors in forming the cited epoxides in humans although they might do so in tissues where they are highly expressed.<ref name = ""Johnson_2015""/>"

The enzyme encoded by this gene is involved in the specific inactivation of to hydroxylated forms, such as 4-oxo-, 4-OH-, and 18-OH-all-trans-retinoic acid. However, if the expression of CYP26B1 is conditionally deleted only prior to E9.5, the limbs are not as severely truncated and more digits are visible. Research suggests that this difference is attributable to the timing of chondroblast differentiation. CYP26B1 has been shown to be over-expressed in cells compared to normal. CYP26B1 expression was also independently prognostic in patients with colorectal cancer and strong expression was associated with a poorer outcome. In the mouse, it has been shown that retinoid-degrading enzyme coded for by the gene, CYP26B1, also plays a major role in male gonad development and spermatogenesis. The actions of retinoic acid(RA) are suppressed by CYP26B1 which halts male germ cell differentiation. RA is responsible for the activation of Stra8 which signals XX germ cells to progress to meiotic prophase I. The actions of Stra8 are inhibited by CYP26B1 until a male is of pubertal age. The mechanism by which CYP26B1 is downregulated in the testis has yet to be discovered.

DBX1,"Homeobox protein DBX1, also known as developing brain homeobox protein 1, is a that in humans is encoded by the ''DBX1''. The DBX1 gene is a transcription factor gene that is pivotal in interneuron differentiation in the ventral spinal cord. The spinal interneurons V0 and V1 are derived from progenitor domains that are differentiated by the expression of homeodomain proteins DBX1 and DBX2. DBX1 is spatially restricted and has a critical role in establishing the distinction of V0 and V1 neuronal fate. In DBX1 mutant mice, neural progenitors fail to generate V0 interneurons and instead gave rise to interneurons expressing V1 characteristics, such as their transcription factor profile, neurotransmitter phenotype, migratory pattern, and aspects of their axonal trajectory, suggesting that this single homeodomain transcription factor coordinates many of the differentiated properties of one class of interneurons generated in the ventral spinal cord. V0 and V1 interneurons are thought to be critical in the role of rhythmic breathing, after using a neonatal mouse model. Destruction of these DBX1 neurons in the pre-Botzinger complex showed an impaired respiratory rhythm as well as a decreased magnitude of motor output activity."

The intermediate and light chains, thought to form the base of the dynein arm, help mediate attachment and may also participate in regulating dynein activity. This gene encodes an intermediate chain dynein, belonging to the large family of motor proteins. Mutations in this gene result in abnormal ciliary ultrastructure and function associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and. The ''DNAI1'' gene is involved in the development of proper respiratory function, motility of spermatozoa, and asymmetrical organization of the viscera during embryogenesis. This gene affects these three very different aspects of development because all three are dependent on proper cilia function. ''DNAI1'' codes for the development of cilia ultrastructure in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, spermatozoa flagellae, and nodal cilia (cilia of the primitive node). ''DNAI1'' specifically encodes for an intermediate chain of the outer dynein arm. Each dynein arm of the ciliary axoneme has an inner and outer dynein arm. A mutation in ''DNAI1'' can lead to defective ciliary beating. A DNAI1 gene mutation accounts for 4-10% of all cases of primary ciliary dyskensia (PCD).

It is produced by cells (s) inside the teeth (dental pulp), and in smaller quantities by bone tissues (osteoblasts and osteocytes). It is required for normal hardening (mineralisation) of teeth. During teeth development, it is broken down into three proteins such as dentin sialoprotein (DSP), dentin glycoprotein (DGP), and dentin phosphoprotein (DPP). These proteins become the major non-ous components of teeth. Their distribution in the matrix of the forming dentin suggests these proteins play an important role in the regulation of mineral deposition. Additional evidence for this correlation is phenotypically manifested in patients with mutant forms of dentin sialophosphoprotein. Such patients suffer dental anomalies including type III. It is coded by a gene of the same name (''dentin sialophosphoprotein'', or ''DSPP'') present on human chromosome 4.

FXYD2,"Sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase gamma chain is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ''FXYD2''. This gene encodes a member of a family of small membrane proteins that share a 35-amino acid signature sequence domain, beginning with the sequence PFXYD and containing 7 invariant and 6 highly conserved amino acids. The approved human gene nomenclature for the family is FXYD-domain containing ion transport regulator. Mouse FXYD5 has been termed RIC (Related to Ion Channel). FXYD2, also known as the gamma subunit of the Na,K-ATPase, regulates the properties of that enzyme. FXYD1 (phospholemman), FXYD2 (gamma), FXYD3 (MAT-8), FXYD4 (CHIF), and FXYD5 (RIC) have been shown to induce channel activity in experimental expression systems. Transmembrane topology has been established for two family members (FXYD1 and FXYD2), with the N-terminus extracellular and the C-terminus on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. The Type III integral membrane protein encoded by this gene is the gamma subunit of the Na,K-ATPase present on the plasma membrane. Although the Na,K-ATPase does not depend on the gamma subunit to be functional, it is thought that the gamma subunit modulates the enzyme's activity by inducing ion channel activity. Mutations in this gene have been associated with renal hypomagnesaemia.<ref name=""entrez"" />"

Under normal conditions, niacin's blood levels are too low to do so: it is given as a drug in high doses in order to reach levels that activate HCA. β-Hydroxybutyric acid, butyric acid, and niacin have actions that are independent of HCA. For example: 1) β-hydroxybutyric acid activates and inhibits some that regulate the of various genes, increase production, and promote defenses; 2) butyric acid activates and like β-hydroxybutyric acid activates free fatty acid receptor 3 and inhibits some histone deacetylases; and 3) niacin is an NAD precursor (see) which when converted to NAD can alter over 500 enzymatic reactions that play key roles in regulating, functions,, and. based on the actions of butyric acid, β-hydroxybutyric acid, niacin, or other HCA activators need to provide data indicating that they actually do so by activating HCA. One commonly used way to do this is to show that the activators have no or reduced effects on ''Hca2'' cells or animals (i.e., cells or animals that had their ''HCa2'' genes removed or inactivated) or cells or animals (i.e., cells or animals that had their ''HCa2'' genes ability to express HCA greatly reduced). The studies reported here on HCA activators focus on those that included experiments in ''Hca2'' gene knockout and/or knockdown cells and animals. Studies, done mostly in animals and the cells taken from animals or humans, show or suggest that HCA functions to 1) inhibit and 2) inhibit inflammation and thereby suppress the development of certain diseases in which inflammation contributes to their development and/or severity.

HDAC2 is broadly regulated by and, but biochemical analysis suggests its regulation is more complex (evinced by the coexistence of HDAC1 and HDAC2 in three distinct protein complexes). Essentially, the mechanism by which HDAC2 is regulated is still unclear by virtue of its various interactions, though a mechanism involving p300/CBP-associated factor and HDAC5 has been proposed in the context of cardiac reprogramming.

HELLS,"Lymphoid-specific helicase (''Lsh'') is a member of the SNF2 helicase family of chromatin remodeling proteins that in humans is encoded by the ''HELLS''. The HELLS gene has proved to play critical roles in DNA methylation, chromatin packaging, control of Hox genes, stem cell proliferation, and developing lymphoid tissue. In a developing embryo, epigenetic programming is controlled through the mechanisms of DNA methylation and chromatin organization. These processes are the master regulators that determine which genes are turned on or off throughout development. ''Lsh'', a protein encoded by the HELLS gene is a major regulator of methylation patterns and thus crucial to normal fetal development. Mutations and knockouts of the HELLS gene severely disrupts the process of fetal programming. In mice, knockout of HELLS gene resulted in death of embryos at birth and caused embryonic growth retardation. In humans, hypomethylation caused by a mutation in the HELLS gene is linked to Immunodeficiency-centromeric instability-facial anomalies syndrome 4 (ICF4). This is a rare disease that causes immunodeficiency, facial anomalies, growth retardation, failure to thrive, and psychomotor retardation. The adverse effects due to the absence and mutation of the HELLS gene is a result of the extensive loss of genomic wide methylation and the abnormal expression of repeat sequences. The disruption in methylation patterns can cause the silencing of genes or the over-expression of genes, leading to abnormal and in some cases fatal developmental consequences. This gene encodes a lymphoid-specific. Other helicases function in processes involving DNA strand separation, including replication, repair, recombination, and transcription. This protein is thought to be involved with cellular proliferation and may play a role in leukemogenesis.

HERC1,"Probable E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase HERC1 is an that in humans is encoded by the ''HERC1''. Knowledge of the gene is facilitated by the discovery of a mouse mutation. The tambaleante (tbl) mutation arose spontaneously on the DW/J-Pas genetic background, a recessive mutation of the Herc1 gene located on mouse chromosome 9 that increases Herc1 protein levels. This protein is largely expressed in many tissues (Sanchez-Tena et al., 2016; https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000103657-HERC1/tissue) and multiple brain regions including the cerebellum (https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000103657-HERC1/brain). Herc1-tbl (tambaleante) mutant mice are characterized by Purkinje cell loss. In addition to the cerebellum, Herc1tbl mutants had lower dendritic spine widths in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Herc1-tbl mutant mice are also characterized by cerebellar ataxia, an unstable gait, and a limb-flexion reflex triggered by tail lifting seen in other cerebellar mutants, the reverse of the normal limb extensor reflex. Relative to wild-type mice, Herc1-tbl mutant mice fell sooner and more often from a rotarod, fell sooner from a vertical pole, slipped more often and took more time to reach the end of a stationary beam and had weaker forelimb grip strength measured by a grip strength meter. The rotarod deficit was rescued when Herc1tbl mutants were bred with transgenic mice expressing normal human HERC1. Herc1tbl mutants were also less adept at landing correctly on all four legs when released in the air. Biallelic HERC1 mutations were reported in two siblings with facial dysmorphism, macrocephaly, motor development delay, ataxic gait, hypotonia, and intellectual disability. Likewise, a nonsense HERC1 variant was reported in one subject with an autosomal recessive condition consisting of facial dysmorphism, macrocephaly, epilepsy, motor development delay, cerebellar atrophy, and intellectual disability. Facial dysmorphism, macrocephaly, and intellectual disability but without cerebellar ataxia were also reported in two siblings with a HERC1 splice variant mutation. The lack of cerebellar involvement was ascribed either to the nature of the mutation or the influence of modifier genes. Another patient with a frameshift HERC1 mutation predicted to truncate the protein displayed facial dysmorphism, macrocephaly, epileptiform discharges, hypotonia, intellectual disability, and autistic features."

The role of the Lck is less prominent in the activation or in the maintenance of memory CD8 T cells in comparison to CD4 T cells. In addition, the role of the lck varies among the memory T cells subsets. It seems that in mice, in the effector memory T cells (TEM) population, more than 50% of lck is present in a constitutively active conformation, whereas, only less than 20% of lck is present as active form of lck. These differences are due to differential regulation by SH2 domain–containing phosphatase-1 (Shp-1) and C-terminal Src kinase. The Lck is responsible for the initiation of the TCR signaling cascade inside the cell by phosphorylating immunoreceptor tyrosine‑based activation motifs (ITAM) within the TCR-associated chains. The Lck can be found in different forms in the immune cells: free in the cytosol or bound to the (PM) through myristoylation and palmitoylation. Due to the presence of the conserved CxxC motif (C20 and C23) in the zinc clasp structure, the Lck is able to bind the cell surface CD8 and\or CD4. Bound and free Lck have different properties: free Lck have more pronounced kinase activity in comparison to bounded Lck, moreover, the free form produces a higher T cell activation. The reasons of these differences are not well understood yet."

MASTL,"''MASTL'' is an official symbol provided by for human gene whose official name is micro tubule associated serine/threonine kinase like. This gene is 32,1 kbps long. This gene is also known as GW, GWL, THC2, MAST-L, GREATWALL. This is present in mainly mammalian cells like, house mouse,,, etc. It is in the 10th chromosome of the mammalian nucleus. Recent studies have been carried on zebrafish and frogs. This gene encodes for the protein micro tubule associated serine/threonine kinase and its sub-classes. Micro-tubule-associated serine/threonine protein kinase is a mammalian enzyme which was first discovered in ''Drosophila'' as an essential kinase (great wall) for correct chromosome condensation and mitotic progression. The EC number for this enzyme is 2.7.11.12. This enzyme is active during mitotic division and is mainly localized in the nucleus during. They get dispersed into the cytoplasm upon the degradation of nuclear envelope during mitosis. The MASTL depleted cells are delayed by RNAi in and show a decreased condensation of the chromosomes. RNAi cells which pass through the mitosis, might not get separated into their sisters in anaphase. This causes the chromatin to be trapped in the cleavage furrow and form 4N G1 cells due to cytokinesis failure. This enzyme enhances the cyclin B1-Cdk1-dependent mitotic phosphorylation events during mitosis. Although Mastl kinase is not essential for metaphase entry, it is required for its maintenance by sustaining spindle assembly checkpoint signaling. Suppression of protein phosphatase 2A activity by Mastl/Arpp19/ENSA pathway leads to sustained high level of Cdk1 substrate phosphorylation until anaphase. It also provides the timely activation of APC/C during Meiosis I and Cdk1 reactivation in meiosis II. Mutation in the gene A mutation in the MASTL gene can lead to an autosomal dominant inherited. The mutation is due to the change in amino acid glutamic acid at 167 to aspartic acid. Common phenotype of a mild thrombocytopenia patient is the decrease average plate counts of 60,000s per ml of blood. Uses in the therapeutic field MASTL enzyme is also used for therapeutic applications such as cancer progression and recurrence after free cancer therapy and this enzyme can be of higher value in the therapeutic market."

Proteins of the (MMP) family are involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix in normal physiological processes, such as embryonic development, reproduction, and tissue remodeling, as well as in disease processes, such as arthritis and metastasis. Most MMPs are secreted as inactive proproteins which are activated when cleaved by extracellular proteinases. However, the protein encoded by this gene is a member of the membrane-type MMP (MT-MMP) subfamily, attached to the plasma membrane via a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol anchor. In response to bacterial infection or inflammation, the encoded protein is thought to inactivate alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor, a major tissue protectant against proteolytic enzymes released by activated neutrophils, facilitating the transendothelial migration of neutrophils to inflammatory sites. The encoded protein may also play a role in tumor invasion and metastasis through activation of MMP2. The gene has previously been referred to as MMP20 but has been renamed MMP25."

There are four major neurofilament subunits, NF-L, NF-M, NF-H and α-internexin. These form heteropolymers which assemble to produce 10nm neurofilaments which are only expressed in neurons where they are major structural proteins, particularly concentrated in large projection axons. Axons are particularly sensitive to mechanical and metabolic compromise and as a result axonal degeneration is a significant problem in many neurological disorders. The detection of neurofilament subunits in CSF and blood has therefore become widely used as a of ongoing axonal compromise. The NF-L protein is encoded by the ''NEFL''. Neurofilament light chain is a biomarker that can be measured with immunoassays in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma and reflects axonal damage in a wide variety of neurological disorders. It is a useful marker for disease monitoring in,,, and more recently. It is also promising marker for follow-up of patients with brain tumors. Higher levels of blood or CSF NF-L have been associated with increased mortality, as would be expected as release of this protein reflects ongoing axonal loss. Recent work performed as a collaboration between and the showed that the NF-L antibodies employed in the most widely used NF-L assays are specific for cleaved forms of NF-L generated by proteolysis induced by cell death. Methods used in different studies for NfL measurement are sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), electrochemiluminescence, and high-sensitive single molecule array (SIMOA)."

Natriuretic peptides (ANP,, and) are a family of hormone/paracrine factors that are structurally related.<ref name = ""Potter_2009"" /> The main function of ANP is causing a reduction in expanded (ECF) volume by increasing excretion. ANP is synthesized and secreted bys in the walls of the in the. These cells contain which respond to increased stretching of the atrial wall due to increased atrial. Reduction of blood volume by ANP can result in secondary effects such as reduction of (ECF) volume, improved cardiac with resultant improved organ perfusion, decreased, and increased serum. These effects may be blunted or negated by various counter-regulatory mechanisms operating concurrently on each of these secondary effects.

PC2 plays only a minor role in the first step of insulin biosynthesis, but a greater role in the first step of biosynthesis compared to PC1. PC2 binds to the neuroendocrine protein named 7B2, and if this protein is not present, proPC2 cannot become enzymatically active. 7B2 accomplishes this by preventing the aggregation of proPC2 to inactivatable forms. The C-terminal domain of 7B2 also inhibits PC2 activity until it is cleaved into smaller inactive forms that lack carboxy-terminal basic residues. Thus, 7B2 is both an activator and an inhibitor of PC2. PC2 has been identified in a number of animals, including ''C. elegans''. In humans, proprotein convertase 2 is encoded by the ''PCSK2''. It is related to the bacterial enzyme subtilisin, and altogether there are 9 different subtilisin-like genes in mammals: ,,,,,, and."

The ''PCSK9'' gene also contains one of 27 associated with increased risk of. PCSK9 is ubiquitously expressed in many tissues and cell types. PCSK9 binds to and degrades the receptor for particles (LDL), which typically transport 3,000 to 6,000 fat molecules (including) per particle, within. The (LDLR), on and other cell membranes, binds and initiates ingestion of LDL-particles from extracellular fluid into cells and the complex to for destruction. If PCSK9 is blocked, the LDL-LDLR complex separates during trafficking, with the LDL digested in the lysosome, but the LDLRs instead recycled back to the cell surface and so able to remove additional LDL-particles from the extracellular fluid. Therefore, blocking PCSK9 can lower blood LDL-particle concentrations. PCSK9 has medical importance because it acts in lipoprotein. Agents that block PCSK9 can lower LDL particle concentrations. The first two PCSK9 inhibitors, and, were approved as once every two week injections, by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2015 for lowering LDL-particle concentrations whens and other drugs were not sufficiently effective or poorly tolerated. The cost of these new medications, , was $14,000 per year at full retail; judged of unclear cost effectiveness by some.

It is important for the dorsoventrally patterning of the limb and has been implicated in the formation of the (AER). The AER is essential for the distal patterning of the limb. Experiments executed in chicken models show Radical fringe is expressed in both the dorsal ectoderm and the AER. This provides evidence that the AER forms from cells already expressing radical fringe, though further evidence is needed to confirm. Grafting experiments have shown that formation of the AER comes from signals in the limb bud. However, radical fringe acts as a permissive signal to create a boundary for the AER to form. The knockout experiments done in chicken models suggest Radical fringe plays an integral role in wing development. Conversely, knockout experiments in mice have shown that if Radical fringe is absent no phenotypic differences occur. Further study revealed the absence of mutation is most likely due to redundancy of Manic and Lunatic fringe, which likely take over in the absence of Radical fringe. Radical, Manic, and lunatic make up a group of enzymes known as 3-beta-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases. They elongate O-linked fucose residues on notch receptors, which effects neurogenesis through the signaling pathway. While Radical fringe may not be vital for limb formation in all species, current research suggests it plays an integral role in establishing the pattern of the developing limb when expressed."

L-selectin plays an important role in both the innate and adaptive immune responses by facilitating leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesion events. These tethering interactions are essential for the trafficking of monocytes and neutrophils into inflamed tissue as well as the homing of lymphocytes to secondary lymphoid organs. L-selectin is also expressed by lymphoid primeds and may participate in the migration of these stem cells to the primary lymphoid organs. L-selectin is composed of multiple structural regions: an N-terminus, an adjacent epidermal growth factor-like domain, two to the consensus repeat units homologous to those found in C3/C4-binding proteins, an extracellular cleavage site, a short transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail. It is cleaved by."

When the contains inadequate amounts of A1AT or functionally defective A1AT (such as in), neutrophil elastase is excessively free to break down, degrading the of thes, which results in, such as, in adults. Normally, A1AT leaves its site of origin, the, and joins the; defective A1AT can fail to do so, building up in the liver, which results in in either adults or. In addition to binding to neutrophil elastase released by inflammatory cells, A1AT also binds to elastase localized on the cell surface in which case elastase does not act as an enzyme, but instead acts to signal cells to undergo locomotion. Besides liver cells, A1PI is produced in bone marrow, by lymphocytic and monocytic cells in lymphoid tissue, and by the Paneth cells of the gut. Inactivation of A1AT by enzymes other than elastase due to inflammation/infection causes the migration of T cells to halt precisely at the site where the pathologic insult exists. This suggests a role for α1PI not only in locomotion of lymphocytes through tissue, but as a consequence of infection, a primary role as a sentinel in immune vigilance. A1AT is both and.

RelA mono-methylation at lysine 310 (RelAK310me1) leads to the constitutive repression of RelA target genes by recruiting the PKMT G9a-like protein (GLP), which catalyzes H3K9me2 and leads to chromatin silencing and gene repression. In response to stimulation with TNFa and lipopolysaccharide, phosphorylation of RelA at serine 311 (RelAS311ph) by PKCzeta physically blocks the interaction between GLP and RelAK310me1, leading to transcription activation. PAK4 Methylation by SETD6 Promotes the Activation of the Wnt/β-Catenin Pathway. SETD6 binds and methylates PAK4 both in vitro and in cells at chromatin. Depletion of SETD6 in various cell lines leads to a dramatic reduction in the expression of Wnt/�-catenin target genes. SETD6 binds to but does not methylate DJ1. Under basal conditions, SETD6 and DJ1 associate with chromatin which inhibits DJ1 to activate Nrf2 transcription activity. In response to oxidative stress, SETD6 mRNA and protein levels are dramatically reduced. SETD6 specifically binds and methylates PLK1 during mitosis at K209 and K413. Depletion of SETD6, as well as the double substitution of the lysine residues (K209/413R), leads to elevation in PLK1 catalytic activity, leading to the acceleration of the different mitotic steps, ending with early cytokinesis."

SLC25A14,"Brain mitochondrial carrier protein 1 is a that in humans is encoded by the ''SLC25A14''. Mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCP) are members of the larger family of mitochondrial anion carrier proteins (MACP). UCPs separate oxidative phosphorylation from ATP synthesis with energy dissipated as heat, also referred to as the mitochondrial proton leak. UCPs facilitate the transfer of anions from the inner to the outer mitochondrial membrane and the return transfer of protons from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane. They also reduce the mitochondrial membrane potential in mammalian cells. Tissue specificity occurs for the different UCPs and the exact methods of how UCPs transfer H+/OH- are not known. UCPs contain the three homologous protein domains of MACPs. This gene is widely expressed in many tissues with the greatest abundance in brain and testis. The gene product has an N-terminal hydrophobic domain that is not present in other UCPs. Two splice variants have been found for this gene.<ref name=""entrez"" /> Mitochondrial uncoupling proteins play a significant role in the human genome as well as in the genomes of plants, prokaryotes, fungi, and other eukaryotes, including all mammals. Humans contain five different isoforms of the uncoupling proteins, and each UCP has its own function in the human body; however, they are all vital in the genome. Past studies demonstrated how decreasing redox signaling and specific UCPs have a neuroprotective role that can protect against a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including hypoxia, ischemia, and illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia. UCP1 The discovery of UCP1 was found in some members of Rodentia but mainly in brown adipose tissue found in infants and plays a role in energy homeostasis. The location of UCP1 is in the inner mitochondrial membrane. The body's brown adipose tissue prevents hypothermia by releasing the proton motive force from oxidative phosphorylation. UCP1 thus controls both the independent and thermogenic metabolisms. Diseases associated with UCP1 include type 2 diabetes and cardiometabolic disease. UCP 2 UCP2 has different functions throughout the body, such as in the brain, lung, kidney, spleen, heart, and skeletal muscle. Additionally, several areas of the central nervous system have consistently high levels of UCP2 mRNA expression. Immediate neurons, invading or dormant monocytes, cells from the choroidal plexus, and endothelial cells are linked to increased UCP2 mRNA levels. Mitochondrial-associated diseases are neuroprotective in several neurodegenerative diseases, including T2D-induced neuronal death, SCZ obesity, inflammatory disease, cancer, and cerebral ischemia (Kumar, 2022). Because of mitochondrial malfunction and modifications to synaptic plasticity, multiple diseases are linked to UCP2. In the damaged area of the brain after a brain injury, UP2 expression rises. In the brain, UCP2's ultimate role is in neuronal plasticity and neuronal survival. Specifically, in cerebral ischemia, studies suggest UCP2 regulates ROS production, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial potential, energy balance, neuroendocrine function, and cell death. Another important function of UCP2 is controlling the temperature of the microenvironment at the presynaptic terminal. According to studies, UCP2 is crucial for neurons' bioenergetic adaptation to increasing neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity. As a result, data from various studies suggests that UCP2 is a plausible therapeutic target for treating neurological conditions. UCP3 UCP3 is mainly expressed in adipose tissue, the lungs, and skeletal muscles; however, it is also found in the brain, kidney, spleen, and heart. The functions of this UCP are to regulate resting metabolic rate, regulate fatty acid metabolism, prevent diabetic neuropathy by preventing nerve loss, limit free radical levels in cells, and limit the level of ROS. UCP3 also reduces the risk of type 1 diabetes, indicating UCPs prevent mitochondrial-mediated neuronal injury (Kumar, 2022). The capacity to control elements affected by energy balance, such as 3-adrenoreceptor agonists, food intake, and exposure to cold, is shared by UCPs 1, 2, and 3. Lastly, cardiovascular disease is associated with UCP3. UCP 4 and 5 The central nervous system is the primary site of expression for UCPs 4 and 5, and each UCP has a distinct function. UCP4 maintains homeostasis by boosting mitochondrial complex II activity in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, enhancing fatty acid oxidation and insulin sensitivity, and decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential in astrocytes, thereby supporting neuronal survival. UCP4 is associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzehmier's, Parkinson’s, and schiperpheria, T2D, and induced neuronal death (Kumar, 2022). UCP4 is located in brain regions such as the hippocampus, substantial nigra, and striatum. UCP5 controls homeostasis by increasing ATP synthesis, mitochondrial polarization, and the prevention of apoptosis. It also maintains the potential of the mitochondrial membrane and lessens oxidative stress against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium MPP+ and dopamine toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. The expression of UCP5 is in neurons and astrocyte cells, and it is BMCP1, a mitochondrial brain carrier protein. UCP5 is associated with aging and the same neurodegenerative diseases as UCP4. Structure As aforementioned, the functions and distributions of the five isoforms of UCPs vary; some are located on the same chromosome in humans, rats, and mice. UCP1 is located on chromosomes 4, 19, and 8. UCP2 is found on chromosomes 11, 1, and 7. Further, UCP2 shares similarities with UCP 1, 3, 4, and 5. Neurodegenerative diseases Worldwide, neurodegenerative disorders pose a serious threat to public health. Along with oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and an imbalance in energy homeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction is a key contributor. One of the most primitive and crucial events in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's is oxidative stress. Reactive oxygen species and inducible nitric oxide synthase are produced primarily in mitochondria, which in Alzheimer’s disease causes the generation of reactive oxygen species and ultimately results in neuronal death (Kumar 2022). Glia maturation factors found in glial cells are linked with the down-regulation of UCPs 2 and 4. A pro-inflammatory protein known as Glia maturation factor has been found close to amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's. It is linked to the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and NF-kB. Various regions of the brain in Alzheimer's disease exhibit up-regulated GMF expression. Neuroinflammation was shown to be a contributing factor in neurodegenerative illnesses, and UCP2 was identified as the primary regulator of M1 and M2 plasticity toward the protective phenotype in brain disorders. The increased production of reactive oxygen species in UCP 2 and 4 results in the development of Alzheimer’s because of the increased chance of apoptosis. Parkinson's disease typically affects adults over the age of 60; however, research indicates that brain injury in people between the ages of 18 and 30 can cause this condition. Over 90% of Parkinson’s cases are isolated, though less than 10% are genetic. Symptoms of Parkinson’s consist of tremors, slow movement, balance impairment, and other disorders accompanied by Parkinson’s. This symptom occurs because of the loss of dopaminergic neurons during the elimination of dopamine neurotransmitters. Because UCP4 is a potential regulator of calcium homeostasis, blocking calcium channels that lower oxidative stress and stop the death of neuronal cells prevents calcium excretion in mitochondria. The leakage of protons and oxygen consumption increase due to increased UCP5 production, resulting in decreased mitochondrial potential and ATP synthesis. Ageing, hypoxia (injured brain), and type 2 diabetes correspond with UCP 2 and 4. The aging brain is a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, and the overexpression of UCP2 can halt the aging process and stop the loss of neurons. Hypoxia occurs when there’s a decrease in oxygen in tissues, which causes cognitive impairment. UCP4 levels rise in response to environmental exposure in humans, shielding the brain from damage. Apopostsis contributes to cerebral ischemia and is necessary for calcium homeostasis, free radical release, the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and energy metabolism. As further research is still being conducted, studies show UCP1 and UCP2 are associated with type 2 diabetes."

SORL1,"Sortilin-related receptor, L(DLR class) A repeats containing is a that in humans is encoded by the SORL1. SORL1 (also known as SORLA, SORLA1, or LR11; SORLA or SORL1 are used, often interchangeably, for the protein product of the SORL1 gene) is a 2214 residue receptor that binds certain peptides and integral membrane protein cargo in the endolysosomal pathway and delivers them for sorting to the retromer multi protein complex; the is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system. Endosomal traffic jams linked to SORL1 retromer dysfunction are the earliest cellular pathology in both familial and the more common sporadic Alzheimer’s patients. Retromer regulates protein trafficking from the early endosome either back to the trans-Golgi (retrograde) or back to the plasma membrane (direct recycling). Two forms of retromer are known: the VPS26A retromer and the VPS26B retromer, the latter being dedicated to direct recycling in the CNS. SORL1 is a multi domain single-pass membrane protein whose large ectodomain resides primarily in endosomal tubules, being connected by its transmembrane helical domain and cytoplasmic tail to the VPS26 retromer subunit on the outer endosomal membrane. The age at onset of SORL1 mutation carriers varies, which has complicated segregation analyses. Nevertheless, protein−truncating variants (PTVs) are observed almost exclusively in AD patients, indicating that SORL1 is haploinsufficient. However, most variants are rare missense variants that can be benign, or risk−increasing, but recent reports have indicated that some variants are causative for disease. In fact, specific missense variants have been observed only in AD cases, some of which may have a dominant negative effect.[https://www.alzforum.org/news/research-news/when-missense-variants-derail-sorl1-traffic-destination-dementia .][https://www.alzforum.org/news/research-news/sorting-out-sorl1-500-mutations-mapped-prioritized-alzforum-dataset] [https://www.alzforum.org/news/research-news/when-missense-variants-derail-sorl1-traffic-destination-dementia] ALZFORUM has created an interactive web page that maps all of the currently known variants onto the schematic of the SORLA domain structure shown in the Figure on the right, along with information for each one.

Patients with XH are male, have short stature, exhibit a mild form of mental retardation and present pan-hypopituitarism. A duplication of the SOX3 gene has also been discovered to cause XX male sex reversal. SRY-box transcription factor 3, SOX3, is a transcription factor that is encoded by the SOX3 gene. This gene is responsible for ensuring proper embryonic development and determining the fate of different cells. Regarding its developmental facet, SOX3, alongside other SOX transcription factors, ensures the proper formation of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis. The proper development of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis is necessary as it serves to ensure proper systemic hormonal function. When SOX3 expression is affected, the development of different structures can be affected as well. Specifically, both the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland can suffer in accomplishing proper growth. Due to this, conditions such as hypopituitarism and mental retardation are found in cases with a lack of SOX3. Also, craniofacial abnormalities can be seen as a result of a lack of the SOX3 gene. To aid in the further understanding of the SOX3 gene, mice have been used as knockout models to study the effects of the gene’s absence."

Cortical development gene Slit-Robo Rho GTPase-activating protein 2 () has been highly conserved over mammalian evolution, and human is the only lineage wherein gene duplications have occurred (three times). The promoter and first nine exons of SRGAP2 duplicated from 1q23.1 () to 1q21.1 () ~3.4 million years ago (mya). Two larger duplications later copied SRGAP2B to chromosome 1p12 (SRGAP2C) and to proximal 1q21.1 () ~2.4 and ~1 mya, respectively. Ancestral SRGAP2A and the derived SRGAP2C copy are fixed at diploid copy number two. In contrast, the SRGAP2B and SRGAP2D are highly copy number polymorphic, with normal individuals identified that completely lack these paralogscopies. SRGAP2C is the most likely duplicate to encode a functional protein and is among the most fixed human-specific duplicate genes. Incomplete duplication created a novel gene function—antagonizing parental SRGAP2 function immediately “at birth” 2–3 mya, which is a time corresponding to the transition from to and the beginning of expansion. SRGAP2C is expressed in the human brain and dimerizes with ancestral SRGAP2 to antagonize it. In the mouse neocortex, SRGAP2 promotes spine maturation and limits spine density. SRGAP2C phenocopies SRGAP2 deficiency and underlies sustained radial migration and results in the emergence of human-specific features, including neoteny during spine maturation and increased density of longer spines. It appears that the SRGAP2C ultimately assumed the antagonistic function of the SRGAP2B duplicate, which shows evidence of pseudogenization in contemporary humans. It is unlikely that SRGAP2B and SRGAP2D are now functional as SRGAP2B has a markedly reduced expression in human brain compared to SRGAP2C and the transcripts produced by SRGAP2D lack two internal exons, leading to a premature termination codon."

The protease can then cleave this complex, releasing bioactive IGF1. Stanniocalcin inhibits the activity of PAPPA in releasing active IGF1 through itself binding PAPPA, thus preventing the release of active IGF1.

SYNE2,"Nesprin-2 is a that in humans is encoded by the ''SYNE2''. The human SYNE2 gene consists of 116s and encodes nesprin-2, a member of the nuclear envelope (NE) spectrin-repeat () family. Nesprins are modular proteins with a central extended spectrin-repeat (SR) rod domain and a C-terminal Klarsicht/ANC-1/Syne homology (KASH) transmembrane domain, which acts as a NE-targeting motif. Nesprin-2 (Nesp2) binds to cytoplasmic, tethering the nucleus to the and maintaining the structural integrity of the nucleus. The human SYNE2 gene encodes a protein of 6,885 amino acids (isoform 1, Nesp2 giant); alternative mRNA splicing produces transcripts encoding a larger isoform and numerous smaller isoforms, some of which are specific to various tissues; alternative start and termination sites within the mRNA also allow translation of smaller isoforms, many possessing unique N- or C-terminal sequences encoded by retained introns. Two mechanisms create splice variants of nesprin-2 with the KASH domain deleted (deltaKASH). In deltaKASH1 variants, deletion of cassette exons 111-112 results in a frame shift that disrupts the KASH domain but retains the 3' untranslated region (UTR) in exon 116 utilized for isoforms containing the KASH domain. This mechanism, which also occurs in SYNE1 mRNA encoding nesprin-1 (), generates deltaKASH1 isoforms terminating with a distinct 11-amino acid tail (GIAGHSATPPA replacing YPMLRYTNGPPPT in isoforms with KASH). Utilization of an alternative stop codon in exon 115, which is followed by a distinct 3' UTR, generates deltaKASH2 variants. This mechanism truncates larger isoforms without generating a distinct C-terminal sequence. Expression of deltaKASH1 variants occurs largely in brain and kidney, with smaller amounts in heart; deltaKASH2 variants are detected in heart and spleen."

TGM5 encodes one member of the multigene transglutaminase family. Transglutaminases (TGs) are involved in protein cross-linking by catalyzing the formation of gamma-glutamyl-lysine isodipeptide bonds between adjacent polypeptides (Candi et al. 2005; Eckert et al. 2005). This process is particularly important in the terminal differentiation of the epidermis, where TGs heavily cross-link keratins and a range of differentiation-specific structural proteins, such as involucrin, loricrin, filaggrin, and small proline-rich proteins, in the formation of the cornified cell envelope in the biogenesis of the stratum corneum, the outermost, “dead” layer of the epidermis (Kalinin et al. 2002). This continuously shed outer layer of the epidermis performs the main barrier function of the skin. Recessive loss-of-function mutations in TGM1 have been shown to cause lamellar ichthyosis, a disease characterized by excessive scaling and shedding of the outer epidermis (Huber et al. 1995; Parmentier et al. 1995; Russell et al. 1995)."

TP63,"Tumor protein p63, typically referred to as p63, also known as transformation-related protein 63 is a that in humans is encoded by the ''TP63'' (also known as the '' p63''). The ''TP63'' gene was discovered 20 years after the discovery of the ' tumor suppressor gene and along with ' constitutes the ''p53'' gene family based on their structural similarity. Despite being discovered significantly later than ''p53'', phylogenetic analysis of ''p53'', ''p63'' and ''p73'', suggest that ''p63'' was the original member of the family from which ''p53'' and ''p73'' evolved."
TP73,"p73 is a protein related to the tumor protein. Because of its structural resemblance to p53, it has also been considered a. It is involved in regulation, and induction of. Like p53, p73 is characterized by the presence of different isoforms of the protein. This is explained bys, and an alternative in the sequence. p73, also known as tumor protein 73 (TP73), protein was the first identified homologue of the tumor suppressor gene, p53. Like p53, p73 has several variants. It is expressed as distinct forms differing at either at the C- or the. Currently, six different C-terminus splicing variants have been found in normal cells. The p73 gene encodes a protein with a significant sequence homology and a functional similarity with the tumor suppressor p53. The over-expression of p73 in cultured cells promotes a growth arrest and/or apoptosis similarly to p53. The p73 gene has been mapped to a chromosome region (1p36. 2-3) a locus commonly deleted in various tumor entities and human cancers. Similar to p53 the protein product of p73 induces cell cycle arrest or apoptosis, hence its classification as a tumor suppressor. However unlike its counterpart, p73 is infrequently mutated in cancers. Perhaps, even more shocking is the fact that p73 – deficient mice do not show a tumorigenic phenotype. A deficiency of p53 almost certainly leads to unchecked cell proliferation and is noted in 60% of cancers. Analyses of many tumors typically found in humans including breast and ovarian cancer show a high expression of p73 when compared to normal tissues in corresponding areas. Adenoviruses that cause cellular transformations have also been found to result in increased p73 expression. Furthermore, recent finding are suggesting that over-expression of transcription factors involved in cell cycle regulation and synthesis of DNA in mammalian cells (e.g.: E2F-1) induces the expression of p73. Many researchers believe that these results imply that p73 may not be a tumor suppressor but rather an oncoprotein. Some suggest that the TP73 locus encodes both a tumor suppressor (TAp73) and a putative oncogene (ΔNp73). This is a strong theory and causes much confusion, as it is unknown which of the two p73 variants is over-expressed and ultimately plays a role in tumorigenesis. Genes of the p53 family are known to be complex. The viral oncoproteins (e.g. Adenovirus E1B) that efficiently inhibit p53 function are unable to inactivate p73, and those that seem to inhibit p73 have no effect on p53. Debate persists about the exact function of p73. Recently it has been reported that p73 is enriched in the nervous system and that the p73-deficient mice, which do not exhibit an increased susceptibility to spontaneous tumorigenesis, have neurological and immunological defects. These results have been expanded and it has also been shown that p73 is present in early stages of neurological development and neuronal apoptosis by blocking the proapoptotic function of p53. This strongly implicates p73 as playing a large role in cellular differentiation."

ZIC5 is classified as a ZIC protein due to conservation of the five C2H2 zinc fingers, which enables the protein to interact with DNA and regulate transcription. Similar to other ZIC family members, ZIC5 is also able to interact with TCF proteins in order to inhibit canonical Wnt signalling. Mutation or loss of ''ZIC5'' has not been associated with any congenital defects in humans. however, loss of ''Zic5'' in mice causes a range of phenotypes including neural crest defects, neural tube defects, hydrocephaly and skeletal defects, indicating multiple functions during early development. Experiments in Xenopus also support the idea that Zic5 can regulate formation of neural crest, suggesting this function is conserved across species. ZIC5 has recently been found to be regulated by the post-translational modification SUMOylation in order to alter the DNA and protein binding properties of ZIC5 to promote neural crest specification. Several other genes involved in the specification of neural crest, including Pax6, Sox9 and Sox10, also been found to be regulated by the same postranslational modification, suggesting that SUMOylation may have a widespread role in formation of the neural crest."
